/*
* SASS is like CSS but extended. Any valid CSS is valid SASS(SCSS).
* With the & symbol you can get the parent selector. For example:
* .container h1{
*   
* }
* Equals to: 
* .container{
*   & h1{
*     
*   }
* }
* 
* Also, you can create variables with the $ symbol. For example:
* $varName: #FFFFFF;
* To use it:
* color: $varName;
*
* The last thing you should know is that you can use SASS functions such as darken(color, ammount) or lighten(color, ammount)
* More info about functions on: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html
